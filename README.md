# Commit Message Prefixes

Use the following prefixes in your commit messages to provide a clear and consistent format:

- **Feat**: Implementing a new feature.
- **Chore**: Removing unused files or code, updating dependencies.
- **Fix**: Used for commits that address bug fixes or resolve issues.
- **Docs**: Used for commits related to documentation changes or updates.
- **Test**: Used for commits related to testing or test infrastructure.
- **Style**: Used for commits that involve code style changes (e.g., formatting, indentation).
- **Refactor**: Used for commits that involve code refactoring without changing functionality.
- **Perf**: Used for commits that improve performance.
- **Build**: Used for commits related to build system or tooling changes.
- **Revert**: Used for commits that revert previous changes.

By using these prefixes, you can provide clear indications of the purpose and nature of your commits, making it easier for others to understand and review your code changes.
